What is difference between path and classpath variables?

   command is used to run a java program or load the source code, and CLASSPATH is an environment variable used by the
   java compiler an JVM to locate and load the required class file.

What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?
A. Interface is completely abstract, we can only declare methods there, we can't implement those. but in Abstract class
   we can have unimplemented and implemented method.

Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class ? if not how do you use it ?
A. no we can't make object from an interface and abstract class. we can instantiate interface or abstract class with
   a concrete class that means we can create object from a concrete class.

what is Access Specifier?

   another class. normally there are 3 types of access specifier- public, private & protected. but classes and interfaces
   can only have public and default access specifier.

What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.
A. OOP concepts are the main ideas behind the java object oriented programming. features-
   1) Abstraction- its implementation hiding. an abstract class can't be instantiated, it must
   have a concrete subclass which will implement the abstract methods of that abstract class.
   2) Encapsulation- its data hiding. its about keeping field within a class private, then providing access to them via public methods.
   its a protective barrier that keeps tha data and code safe within the class itself.
   3) Inheritance- it lets us create new classes that shares some of the attributes of existing classes.

   4) Polymorphism-
